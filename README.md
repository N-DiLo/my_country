- [flutter_screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil): A flutter plugin for adapting screen and font size. For general responsiveness with text and all screen sizes (i.e. tablet, mobile or desktop)

- [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http): The http package allows set of high-level functions and classes that make it easy to consume HTTP resources. It's multi-platform, and supports mobile, desktop, and the browser.

- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): A wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable.
By using provider instead of manually writing InheritedWidget, you get:

 - a vastly reduced boilerplate over making a new class every time

- [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences): A plugin used for storing critical data due to asynchronous persistence of data. The plugin wraps platform-specific persistent storage for simple data (NSUserDefaults on iOS and macOS, SharedPreferences on Android, etc.).
